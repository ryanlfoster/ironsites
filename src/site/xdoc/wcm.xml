			<dl>
				<dt>What is the motivation for these features?</dt>
				<dd>Toggling display behavior based on WCMMode is very common. 
					The boilerplate involved in the JSP import and comparison
					code doesn't feel ideal. Dealing with this minor annoyance
					in a global.jsp include is the common approach, which is
					fine. Let's shoot for slightly better.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>What does this provide that isn't out-of-box?</dt>
				<dd>&lt;isw:modeHelper/&gt; provides JSP variable and EL access
					to a Map with WCMMode comparisons and an WCMMode instance.<br/>
					&lt;ism:wcmmode mode=&quot;edit|disabled|preview|etc&quot;/&gt; 
					wraps JSP body content for scoped for a given WCMMode, works across versions with newer modes<br/>
                    </dd>
				
				<dt>What are some limitations?</dt>
				<dd>Newer WCMModes won't work in older CQ/AEM versions</dd>
					
				<dt>Where are the tests?</dt>
				<dd>Working on it...</dd>
