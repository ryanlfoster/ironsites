			<dl>
				<dt>What is the motivation for these features?</dt>
				<dd>Application caches can be helpful if you have some spare
				 	memory around, especially if you have parameterized
				 	requests or other 'live' requests which bypass dispatcher
				 	and hit an application server directly to retrieve the same
				 	information repeatedly. EHCache, OSCache, and the like are
				 	absolutely fine. However, simplicity is a virtue, and the
				 	cache provided by <a href="https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/CachesExplained" target="_blank">Google Guava</a>
				 	is virtuous in this way.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>What does this provide that isn't out-of-box?</dt>
				<dd>An simple, configurable Cache that is slightly more 
					utilitarian than ConcurrentHashMap.</dd>
				
				<dt>What are some limitations?</dt>
				<dd>Type safety hazards ahead. The OSGi Service created to
					manage this cache has not been abstracted to support
					alternative implementations like the Spring 3.2+.</dd>
					
				<dt>Where are the tests?</dt>
				<dd>Working on it...</dd>
