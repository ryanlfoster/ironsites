		<section name="What/Why?">
			<dl>
				<dt>What is the motivation for these features?</dt>
				<dd>Application caches can be helpful if you have some spare
				 	memory around, especially if you have parameterized
				 	requests or other 'live' requests which bypass dispatcher
				 	and hit an application server directly to retrieve the same
				 	information repeatedly. EHCache, OSCache, and the like are
				 	absolutely fine. However, simplicity is a virtue, and the
				 	cache provided by <a href="https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/CachesExplained" target="_blank">Google Guava</a>
				 	is virtuous in this way.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>What does this provide that isn't out-of-box?</dt>
				<dd>An simple, configurable Cache that is slightly more 
					utilitarian than ConcurrentHashMap.</dd>
				
				<dt>What are some limitations?</dt>
				<dd>Type safety hazards ahead. The OSGi Service created to
					manage this cache has not been abstracted to support
					alternative implementations like the Spring 3.2+.</dd>
					
				<dt>Where are the tests?</dt>
				<dd>Working on it...</dd>

		<section name="SimpleCache">
			<p>
				The javadoc for SimpleCacheService really should be the best
				usage explanation. When a cache is requested by name, it is 
				provided or a new basic Cache is created and provided.
				Additionally, one method can spawn a Cache instance with
				configurable specifications and a toggle to record statistics.
			</p>
			<p>
				Google Guava Cache instances are created by a CacheBuilder 
				factory that accepts a <a href="http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/google/common/cache/CacheBuilderSpec.html" target="_blank">specification String.</a>
				This is particularly useful for tuning. Changing Cache specs
				established in code may be daunting which is why an OSGi
				configuration factory allows for Cache instances to be created
				with configurable specifications.
			</p>
			<p>
				To add OSGi managed cache configurations, go to felix configuration
				manager console (/system/console/configMgr) and locate
				"ironsites - Simple Cache Configuration". Add configurations and
				you can confirm the creation of Cache instances in the
				cachemonitor CQ component.
