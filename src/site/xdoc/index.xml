			<ul>
				<li>AEM (a.k.a. Adobe CQ) 5.6 or 6</li>
                <li>maven3</li>
			</ul>
			Minor modifications to version numbers in the POM should make most
			if-not-all features available in CQ 5.5. However, let's try to keep
			moving forward. 5.6 and 6 are out and ready to party.
		</section>
        <section name="AEM Interop">
            As mentioned in the README, there are AEM6 and AEM5 specific maven profiles 
            which correct some dependency and bundle exports. Some libraries not found
            in AEM 5 are provided out-of-box in AEM 6.
            <blockquote>mvn clean install -P local-author,aem5</blockquote>
            The above should be used for a localhost author instance of CQ 5.6 running on 4502. 
            AEM 6 is the default active profile assumption.
