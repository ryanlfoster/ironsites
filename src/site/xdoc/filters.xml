				<dt>What is the motivation for these features?</dt>
				<dd><a href="http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/javadoc/com/day/cq/wcm/api/PageFilter.html">PageFilter</a>
					is limiting and makes a number of assumptions. The result
					of those assumptions in the professional services field
					is often re-creating navigation and sitemap components.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>What does this provide that isn't out-of-box?</dt>
				<dd>Implementations of Filter&lt;Page&gt; that provide static
					instances that maintain some assumptions but also provide
					some flexibility to developers and designers.</dd>
				
				<dt>What are some limitations?</dt>

		<section name="List/And/Or Filters">
			<p>
				ListPageFilter is an abstract class which provides extensions 
				management around aggregated Filters.
			</p>
			<p>
				AndPageFilter extends ListPageFilter and will include a page if
				<b>all</b> of the aggregate Filters include a page.
			 </p>
			<p>
				OrPageFilter extends ListPageFilter and will include a page if
				<b>any</b> of the aggregate Filters include a page.
			 </p>
		</section>
		<section name="Property Equals Filters">
			<p>
				PropertyEqualsFilter is an abstract class which provides
				structure to acquiring and checking equality for a property
				value, and supporting negation as an option.
			</p>
			<p>
				StringEqualsFilter extends PropertyEqualsFilter and will include a page if
				a property value, coerced to String, is equal to another String.
			 </p>
			<p>
				BooleanEqualsFilter extends PropertyEqualsFilter and will include a page if
				a property value, coerced to a Boolean, is equal to another Boolean.
			 </p>
		</section>
		<section name="Hide/Show/Invalid Filters">
			<p>
				The out-of-box PageFilter has an option to check if a Page
				is invalid (Page#isInvalid), and InvalidPageFilter performs
				similar work, but with other checks factored away.
			</p>
			<p>
				HidePageFilter operates performs the work of the out-of-box 
				PageFilter but does so as an AndPageFilter which composes 
				InvalidPageFilter and BooleanEqualsFilter for an opt-out 
				property to equal true; 'hideInNav' by default. A constant
				instance with default behavior is available for use instead 
				if the those assumptions are sufficient.
			 </p>
			<p>
				ShowPageFilter is an opt-in version of the HidePageFilter where
				a page is filtered out if it is invalid or it has a property
				that does not equal true; 'showInNav' by default. A constant
				instance with default behavior is available for use instead 
				if the those assumptions are sufficient.
